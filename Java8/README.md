-> Interface which has one abstract method and multiple default and static methods is called Functional interface.

-> To create a custom functional interface use  @FunctionalInterface

-> We can implement the Functional programming in java using Lambda expression

-> Lambda expression won't generate the ".class " files

Java8 has given below pre-defined functional interfaces
1. Consumer Interface
has method (i.e. accepts) that accepts T type as parameter and returns void.
2. Predicate Interface
has method (i.e. test) that accepts T type as parameter and returns boolean
4. Supplier Interface
has method ( i.e. get) that accepts no argument and returns the T type
